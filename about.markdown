  <p>Rosalvo&rsquo;s&nbsp;entire life is dedicated to creativity and exploration. From his love of design and animation through to his passion for music and drumming, everything he does revolves around being creative and free with his thoughts &ndash; you can think of his brain as a kaleidoscope of sound, rhythm and colours!</p>
  
  <p>He was born in the US, raised in Portugal and now lives in London &ndash; having this international background allows him to bring a range of cultural experiences to his creative process that you can see in his work.</p>
  
  <p>When it comes to your work, he works tirelessly to understand what the true meanings are behind your ideas and then applies his creativity, professionalism and hard work, to always ensure what is produced is better than what you wanted.</p>
  
  <p>That&rsquo;s what I think, but what do I know, I only hear his drums reverberate through me on stage!</p>
